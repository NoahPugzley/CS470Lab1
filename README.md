This simple script creates a main directory with the current date and time as the name, then creates within it ten subdirectories using a for loop.
Each Subdirectories then had a file named tuser501.txt to tuser510.txt containing a unique programming language within each by using an array for each of the languages.

Here are some descriptions of commands used in linux:

"cp" - This command is for copying files or directories. the command can be used as such: 'cp source.txt dest.txt' This simply copies the files contents to another file.

"ps" - This command (process status) processes that took place or are active, allowing users to see the time it started and how long it took, as well as other information such as the amount of resources the process took. This command can be used as such: 'ps aux' This example shows all process that are active or were run, and the information about them.

"ls" - This command (list directory contents), makes a list of all the directories and files within the currently selected directory or a specified directory. An example of this command is 'ls -l' which shows a list of all files in your current directory with longer format giving more information for each file.

"mv" - This command (Move/Rename Files), moves files from one directory to another or renames them. An example of this is: 'mv name1.txt name2.txt' This usage of the command renames a txt file to a new one.

"rm" - This command (Remove File/Directory), as the name implies, removes/deletes a specified file or directory. An example of this command looks like this: 'rm file.txt'.

"mkdir" Ths command (Make Directory), creates an empty directory given a name.
